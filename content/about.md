We are a group of individules who have a passion for Security and Cloud Automation. The reason that we started UNIT-6 was that we noticed that there was a gap in Security departmets. Security departments had not utilized the automation that a lot of dev/ops have become accustomed to. Our goal is the help develop solutions that tie directly into SOC workflows. We are the bridge between dev workflows and SoC protection, providing Autonomic Security Operations.
