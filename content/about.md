We are a group of individuals who have a passion for Security and Cloud Automation. The reason that we started UNIT-6 was to help organizations fill a gap in security automation. We noticed that security departments have not incorporated security as code nor built out automations around workflows. Our goal is the help develop solutions that tie directly into SOC workflows. We are the bridge between dev workflows and SOC protection, providing Autonomic Security Operations.
